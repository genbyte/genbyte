I like to write software and play with hardware! Have a look at [my website](https://bookcase.name)!

## Here's some stuff I made!

#### Tools
- Send an HTTP request to [retstat][retstat] with a status code in the URL path
  and get a response with that status code
- Compile binary files with [hext][hext] from a format of the same name
- Convert your images [towebp][towebp] using this small program
- Use [rnprefix][rnprefix] to remove file prefixes en masse

[retstat]: https://github.com/genbyte/retstat
[hext]: https://github.com/genbyte/hext
[towebp]: https://github.com/genbyte/towebp
[rnprefix]: https://github.com/genbyte/rnprefix
