Hello! I like to write small tools and toys in hopes of bettering the lives of those who use them. My language of choice is Rust but I feel like I can handle myself in Javascript, Java, and C, among others.

I like getting email! If you want to chat you can reach me at [gen@nyble.dev](mailto:gen@nyble.dev). I very much like exploring people's websites. If you do, too, you can find mine here: <https://nyble.dev>

I write a lot of small tools for the command line, here are some of my favorites:  
⬡ A binary file markup language and compiler, [Hext][hext]  
🖼 A simple to use command line tool for converting images [towebp][towebp]  
➠ [rnprefix][rnprefix] for removing common filename prefixes, like an album name  
🗚 Command line image scaler [neam][neam] \
🎆 Type pixel art and then compile it with [tep][tep]

[towebp]: https://github.com/gennyble/towebp
[rnprefix]: https://github.com/gennyble/rnprefix
[neam]: https://github.com/gennyble/neam
[neam]: https://github.com/gennyble/tep

Here are some crates I've written and try to maintain:   
➥ a tree based configuration language. [confindent][confindent] mimcs ~/.ssh/config  
🏗 [bempline][bempline] used to stand for "bad template engine"  
🎁 [gifed][gifed] provides a high and low-level API for gif files

[confindent]: https://github.com/gennyble/confindent
[bempline]:https://github.com/gennyble/bempline
[gifed]: https://github.com/gennyble/gifed
