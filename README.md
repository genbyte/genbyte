I like writing software. Tiny tools are super cool.

Have a look aroud my repositories! There's also a small directory of things I've made/am making over here: [nyble.dev/thing](https://nyble.dev/things.html)

I'm currently working on:  
- A GIF focused image viewer. It supports a bunch of image formats, but our goal is to make the GIF support best-in-class.
- turquoise: a third party scrobble server. Like LastFM but you own the data.

Those repositories are currently private, but will be opened on initial release.

Public repos that I touch from time to time:
- [confindent](https://github.com/gennyble/confindent). Rust crate; Configuration format based on indentation
- [textual](https://github.com/gennyble/textual). A little thing I work on when I want to play with text rendering. Makes a text-focused image from URL query parameters.

If you think something is cool or I've improved your life in some way, consider [sponsoring me][sponsor]!
