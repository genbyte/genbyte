i like to write software. small things are nice.

**currently** *(last edited Mar 4th, 2023)*  
- Implicit/Explicit TLS for [Sail](https://github.com/mademast/sail)
- Linux client for [heartbeat](https://nyble.dev/heartbeat.html).

*heartbeat is currently private, but will be opened on initial release. if you want to view the code early, you can get access with the $10/mo sponsor tier and above*
