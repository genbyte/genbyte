Hello! I like to write software of questionable utility and varying weirdness.

My current objective is to finish[^†] some or the projects I already have started.

Thank you to the three people, the sponsors, that give me some money every month <3

[^†]: "finish" to mean get somewhere I am happy with calling version 1; get them to a point i'd be happy to call "done" if i could let things rest
