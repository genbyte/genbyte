- [Tone curve editor][curver] for [gaze][gaze]
- Color picker (also for gaze)
- Webserver for nyble.dev *(why oh why, oh no)*

[gaze]: https://github.com/eclecticnybles/gaze
[curver]: https://github.com/eclecticnybles/gaze/blob/main/curver/README.md

*on the backburner while i get distracted, hopelessly, with other things*
- TLS for [Sail][sail]
- Linux client for [heartbeat][nyble-heartbeat]

*heartbeat is currently private, but will be opened on initial release. if you want to view the code early, you can get access with the $10/mo sponsor tier and above*
