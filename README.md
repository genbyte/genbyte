i like to write software. small things are nice.

**currently** *(last edited Mar 12th, 2023)*  
- Tone curve editor for [gaze][gaze]

[gaze]: https://github.com/eclecticnybles/gaze

*on the backburner while i get distracted, hopelessly, with other things*
- TLS for [Sail][sail]
- Linux client for [heartbeat][nyble-heartbeat]

*heartbeat is currently private, but will be opened on initial release. if you want to view the code early, you can get access with the $10/mo sponsor tier and above*
