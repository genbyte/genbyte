Hello! I'm Genevive and my pronouns are they/them. I like to write small tools and toys in hopes of bettering the lives of those who use them. My language of choice is Rust but I feel like I can handle myself in Javascript, Java, and C, amung others.

I like getting email! If you want to chat you can reach me at [gen@nyble.dev](mailto:gen@nyble.dev). I very much like exploring people's websites. If you do, too, you can find mine here: <https://nyble.dev>

I write a lot of small tools for the command line, here are some of my favorites:  
â¬¡ A binary file markup language and compiler, [Hext][hext]  
ðŸ–¼ A simple to use command line tool for converting images [towebp][towebp]  
âž  [rnprefix][rnprefix] for removing common filename prefixes, like an album name  
ðŸ—š Command line image scaler [neam][neam]

[towebp]: https://github.com/gennyble/towebp
[rnprefix]: https://github.com/gennyble/rnprefix
[neam]: https://github.com/gennyble/neam

But that's not all I write! Here are some projects I'm particularly proud of

[gifed][gifed] is a Rust crate for reading and writing gif files. It gives you full control while trying to stay simple to use.

[Sail][sail] is a spec compliant SMTP server and relay. It's still in it's early stages of developement.
